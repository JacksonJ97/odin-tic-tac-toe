# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe game built with clickable buttons which inputs player X's and player O's inputs in alternating clicks. A winner is decided when the win conditions are met. If the draw conditions are met then the outcome will be a draw. When the game is over, a restart button is available to click which allows the users to play again. The outcome of the game is displayed when an outcome is reached.

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JS

### What I learned

I reinforced my ability to manipulate the DOM by attaching event listeners to the buttons, and by displaying a text which corresponded to the state of the game. I learned how to break down the game logic using JavaScript patterns such as factory functions and modules.
